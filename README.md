# Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting lung cancer using machine learning techniques based on patient-related data. The objective is to analyze the dataset, perform proper preprocessing, visualize key features, and compare multiple classification models to evaluate their performance.

The project is implemented in **Python** using popular data science and machine learning libraries and is presented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.

## 📊 Dataset Description

* The dataset contains patient-related attributes associated with lung cancer risk.
* Data preprocessing includes:

  * Handling missing/null values
  * Feature encoding
  * Feature scaling
* The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)
* **Scikit-learn**

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Implemented

The following classification algorithms are implemented and compared:

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Gaussian Naive Bayes

Model performance is evaluated using accuracy scores, both **with and without feature scaling**, to analyze the impact of preprocessing.

## 📈 Key Features

* Data visualization for better understanding of feature distributions
* Comparison of multiple ML models
* Evaluation of model performance before and after scaling
* Clean and structured workflow for beginners in machine learning
